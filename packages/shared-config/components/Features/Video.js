      The TeamSectionWithBadgesAndVideo component is designed to showcase a team, company, or product, combining rich textual content with badges and an embedded video. This component is split into two main parts: the left section contains the text content (subheading, heading, paragraph) and badges representing key achievements or metrics, while the right section features an embedded video. The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes with a column layout for smaller screens and a row layout for larger screens. The badges are styled with icons and numbers to highlight key information such as awards, milestones, or achievements. The call-to-action (CTA) button encourages users to take further action, such as watching the video, learning more, or contacting the team. This component is ideal for use on landing pages, about pages, or promotional sections where visual engagement and key highlights are crucial.`,
