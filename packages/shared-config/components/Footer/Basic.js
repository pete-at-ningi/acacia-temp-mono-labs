      The FooterWithContactAndSocials component is a highly customizable footer section that includes contact information, social media links, and navigation to key pages. It is divided into three main columns: contact details (business name, address, email, and phone), navigation links to important pages, and social media links. Additionally, it includes legal details and a newsletter subscription form for staying updated. This component is responsive, adjusting its layout from a single column on smaller screens to a three-column grid on larger screens. The footer also includes credit information at the bottom and a copyright statement. It is ideal for websites looking to provide easy access to contact information, page links, and social media engagement.`,
